Genesis Repository; will be used to get familiar with this platform

I am changing over from being in real estate finance to building software. I intend to become a blockchain specialist. Am in the process of learning javascript along with node.js, angular, JSON, and AJAX; as well as Python, C++, and Solidity. It's been an interesting ride so far. Shout out to Udemy. I've learned a lot from them.
